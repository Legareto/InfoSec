title: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
---
**Identify, define,** and **catalog** publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

We can think of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program as a dictionary of vulnerabilities.

It provides a standardized identifier for vulnerabilities and security issues in software and hardware products.

- Each vulnerability is assigned a CVE ID with a standardized format like `CVE-2024-29988`.
- This unique identifier (CVE ID) ensures that everyone from security researchers to vendors and IT professionals is referring to the same vulnerability, [CVE-2024-29988](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29988) in this case.

The [MITRE Corporation](MITRE.md) maintains the CVE system.
