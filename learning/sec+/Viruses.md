A virus is a type of [malicious software](Malware.md) ([malware](Malware.md)) designed to spread to other computers.

It typically attaches itself to legitimate software and executes its code when the host software runs 

## Propagation

Unlike worms, which **can spread** across networks on their own, viruses **usually require some form of user action to replicate**, such as opening a file or running a program.

## Infection Mechanisms

- **File Infector Viruses:** These attach themselves to executable files and spread to other executables when the program is run.
- **Macro Viruses:** These are written in the macro language of applications (like Microsoft Word) and are spread through documents.
- **Boot Sector Viruses:** They infect the master boot record of a hard drive, ensuring they are executed when the computer boots up.

## Detection and Removal

- **Antivirus Software:** Uses signatures to detect known viruses and heuristics to detect new, unknown viruses.
- **Regular Updates:** Keeping antivirus software updated with the latest virus definitions is crucial for protection.
- **System Scans:** Regular scanning for viruses.
