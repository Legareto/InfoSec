A type of surveillance software or hardware that, once installed on a system, has the **capability to record every keystroke made** on that system.

The primary purpose of a keylogger is to covertly monitor and log all the key presses made by a user, which can include sensitive data like usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages.

Keyloggers can be software-based or hardware-based:

- **Software Keyloggers:** These are programs that get installed on the user's computer. They can be part of a malicious software package, like a virus or a [Trojan](Trojan.md).
- **Hardware Keyloggers:** These are small
  physical devices that can be plugged into a
  computer, usually between the keyboard and
  the PC, to capture keystrokes.
