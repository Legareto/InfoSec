A rootkit is a **clandestine computer program** designed to **provide continued privileged access** to a computer while actively hiding its presence from administrators and other system users.

Rootkits can be installed by a malicious intruder after gaining access to a system or can piggyback on other software installations.

## Measures

- Secure System Access
- Antivirus and Anti-Rootkit Tools
- System Hardening
- Patch Management
- Secure Boot:
  - Use hardware and software that supports secure boot processes to prevent unauthorized code from running during system startup.
