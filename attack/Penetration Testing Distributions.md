title: Penetration Testing Distributions
---
There are many different distributions that we can use, all of which have different advantages and disadvantages.

The tools installed on these operating systems can be installed on pretty much any distribution, so we should instead ask ourselves what we should expect from this #Linux distribution for penetration testing.

The best penetration testing distributions are characterized by their large and active community and comprehensible and detailed documentation. Among the most popular include, but not limited to:

- ParrotOS (Pwnbox)
- Kali Linux
- BlackArch
- BackBox
