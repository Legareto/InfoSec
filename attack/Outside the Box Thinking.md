title: Outside the Box Thinking
---


This art of thinking, called "Outside the box," is an essential part of the "hacker mindset", or the way we must think as penetration testers to solve complex problems.

Thinking outside the box means seeing things outside of the limitations placed on us.

This means we have to be able to "pivot." We have to focus on so many different technologies during our penetration tests that it can become confusing and frustrating when we do not understand some things.

> A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.

## Know your goal

We will overcome the obstacles which are put in our way. If we do not have a goal, we will stop at the first obstacle. Without a goal, we will be disoriented moving from one topic to another.

> Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning.

## Attention to details

There are many ways that we become "stuck". It could be that we focused too much and lost the context of the task at hand, or we are tired and did not take enough breaks. Solving a problem like this requires creativity.

In penetration testing, it is essential to pay attention to details that appear unimportant at first glance. If we look back, we will see some terms printed in bold and green, and if we take a closer look, we will see that they have an essential meaning in the process. **Here it is crucial to train the eye to notice even the most minor details**.

## Fear and Thinking

> Fear is a state and the product of our imagination of the future and its consequences where the present is suppressed.

> People fear what might happen in the future while not considering the present.

We must **keep a clear goal in mind** to prevent this from happening so quickly.

## Success

> Decide (Decision Making) on the goal defined in detail (The Goal) that you really want to achieve from your heart (Willingness), and that will make you happy consciously and subconsciously (The Brain).

## Focus

> Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal.

## Attention

> Attention is influenced by your interests, needs, personal attitudes, beliefs, orientations, goals, and experiences.

## Comfort Zone

## Winner VS Loser

> The difference between a winner and a loser is that the winner has lost more often than the loser.


## Questioning

> The most important and most difficult thing in any situation is not the search for the right answer but the search for the right question.

> Once we know the goal (The Goal) to which we are attracted (Willingness), we can use various principles, such as the Pareto Principle or Occam's Razor, to develop our talents (Talent) and skills and make our decisions (Decision Making) to pass the obstacles that fall across our path by asking the right questions (Questioning).


## Relationship-Oriented-Questioning (ROQ) Model

| **Component**     | **Description**                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Your Position     | This describes the position we are in and our view.                                                                       |
| The Object        | The object is the core element of the question. The main component of our sentence takes the meaning out of the question. |
| Known             | This information is known to us.                                                                                          |
| Unknown           | This information is not known to us.                                                                                      |
| Other Position(s) | This component describes the position of other persons.                                                                   |

1. We need to find out the core element of the question and insert it as the object.
2. We must have at least two components defined in the model. More than two components are optional.

Example : 
- What are all the methods available to remotely access Windows operating systems?

## Right Question

> A right question is a precise question that allows us to establish the relationships between the components, to understand them, and to take us one step further to the required answer.
