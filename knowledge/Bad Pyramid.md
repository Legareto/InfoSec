# The Teams

## Red Team

Attackers, simulate threats against an organisation and effectively test the security measures implemented by an organisation.

## Blue Team

Defenders, keeping the network and users secure. Their job is to protect and defend an organisationâ€™s assets from threats and act on detections.

## Purple Team

Act as a mediator between red and blue. They are tasked with boosting the effectiveness of the Red and Blue teams. The purple team add value with insight from attackers but with added incident response and defensive practices to effectively up skill both sides and improve security over all.

## Yellow Team

The general builders, usually software developers or architects. Responsible for creation of networks, software or implementation of other assets.

## Green Team

Builders who change their design and implementation based on defense knowledge. Similar to the orange team, however instead of taking cues from the red team, these are drawn from defensive practices.

## Orange Team

Building based on input from attacker knowledge, the orange team is made up of a yellow team but with direct input from a red team mindset, which results in adaptations of implementations based on attacker knowledge.

## Black Team

Usually referred to as physical security assessments, the naming is drawn from black op engagements whereby the teams used to dress in all black to carry out stealth operations. Key features of a black op(eration) are that it is secret and it is not attributable to the organisation carrying it out.

## White Team

The team that establishes the rules of engagement and are usually the employees of the organisation who are undertaking a red or purple team engagement. The white team does not conduct any testing.
